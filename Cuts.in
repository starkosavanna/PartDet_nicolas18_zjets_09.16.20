////////////////////// Cuts ///////////////

//// This file gives all of the multiplicity cuts that are made in the code.  The order of the cuts can be changed
//// 
//// The first variable is the name that corresponds to the CUTS enum value that holds the number of "good" 
//// particles that correspond to the name.  These are defined in the map called "cut_num" in src/Analyzer.cc
//// The next two numbers are the minimum and maximum number of particles allowed.  -1 corresponds to infinity
//// ie
//// NParticleA 2 -1
//// means the particle "ParticleA" must have at least 2 particles.
//// The cuts are applied cumulatively, so after a cut, only events that passed that cut will be considered in the
//// next cut

//// If you want to see the histograms after a specific multiplicity cut, you can make that cut into a folder by
//// putting *** before the cut name.  The folder will hold histograms that were filled AFTER the cut is applied
//// ie
//// ***NParticleB 0 0
//// means a folder with histograms filled after the cut of have exactly 0 of "ParticleB"

# The following was modified by NDS on 06/30/20.  NRecoTriggers1 is a boolean which turns on/off Trigger1 in Run_info.in.  For 
# example, if we have Trigger1FirstRequirement HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau in Run_info.in, we must turn it on here.  We can do s by
# setting it as ***NRecoTriggers1     1   -1.  If we delete the 3 asterisks and change it to NRecoTriggers1     0   -1, it'll be
# turned off.
